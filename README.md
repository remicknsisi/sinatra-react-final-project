# sinatra-react-final-project
Welcome to my recipe-collecting single page application! I call it *What's Cookin'?*, as it is designed to assist users to never struggle to decide what's for dinner again. I've collected and organized inspirational recipes from some of the country's favorite celebrity chefs. 

Navigate and peruse top-line recipe inspo in the 'Recipes' tab, and hit 'read more' to be provided with ingredients, instructions, and reviews pertaining to that recipe. In the Recipes tab, I have built in the functionality to allow users to filter recipes by type (mains, sides and desserts) as well as by "favorites," categorized by those you've marked as favorited. From the more details page on each recipe, feel free to leave your own opinion in the comments for future chefs' benefit.

The 'Chefs' tab will provide you a top-line look at all the different celebrity chefs who have so graciously shared their favorite dishes with the internet. To learn more about our inspirations, visit their more details pages for a short bio. If you prefer to check out recipes from the starting point of your favorite chef, the 'read more' for each chef allows you to do so by clicking out on a recipe from that chef's page.

While I have seeded the database with some preliminary delicious options, make the app useful to you by storing your very own favorite recipes for later. Stumble across a favorite recipe elsewhere, or master one of your own, and want to store it in the database for future meals? Feel free to add the Chef in the 'Add New Chef' tab, especially if the chef is you! From the new Chef page you create, you can easily add in related recipes.
